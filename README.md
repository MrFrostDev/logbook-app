## General Info
The logbook-app is an app that allows users to view and capture their tours. The app is divided into three parts: the frontend, the backend (often referenced as REST-API) and the chaincode. The frontend is an Expo App (React Native) that allows users to view and capture their tours. The backend is a REST API that manages the communication with the chaincode.
The chaincode is a Hyperledger Fabric chaincode that manages the data of the tours. All three parts must be running in order to use the app. Example-Instances of the backend and the chaincode are hosted and available for use. So for testing purpose it is enough to just run the frontend.
